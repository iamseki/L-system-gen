# L-System

<p align="center">This project implements a simple example of L-system.
 
## How to use :scroll:

- Just open the path of [index.html](./src/index.html) in your browser.

>The function that `generates the string` based on alphabet of symbols and the rule <strong>F &#8618; FF+[+F-F-F]-[-F+F+F]</strong> is implemented in [this function](./src/scripts/lindenmayer.js)

## What expect from Index.html :camera:

<img src="./sample.png"/> 

---

### Considerations :grimacing:

There is a "CSS problem" with the canvas created and manipuled by `P5js` library which is used to draw the weird string generated by L-System. Since this problem does not interfere with the program's functionality, I hope to solve it someday :sweat_smile:
